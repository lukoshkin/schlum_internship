parameters' definitions
=======================

# N             number of grid nodes along the x-axis
# M             number of step along the t-axis to be made
# l             dimension size (line segment on the x-axis)
# dt            time step 
# tau           relaxation time of gradient flows
# D             diffusion coefficient
# alpha          + \alpha (u(x,t) - u^*) - significance deegre of source term
# beta          check for beta != 0  -  u_x(0) - \beta u(0) = 0
# delta         the less it is, the better for you, but prevent it from taking zero value
# u_special     u^* in term + \alpha (u(x,t) - u^*)
